## Proposed Infrastructure Architecture

![design](design.jpg "Architecture")

* AWS Fargate
* AWS Application Load Balancer

The application load balancer should have an `/service` endpoint and `/__healthcheck__` health check endpoint.

If something is missing, feel free adding it to a solution.

## Objectives

The task objectives were as follows:

* Create infrastructure-as-code as per proposed Architecture
* `Makefile` has all the commands requred to run/test
* Explain how to run in `README.md`

Optional

* Test Infrastructure (you can choose one or more test frameworks)
	* [Terraform BDD Testing](https://github.com/eerkunt/terraform-compliance)
	* [Terraform Unit Testing](https://github.com/bsnape/rspec-terraform)
	* [Terraform Ultimate Testing](https://github.com/bsnape/rspec-terraform)

## Deploy

cd to terraform 
terraform plan
terraform apply

## Test the whole setup

TODO: Document how to test the setup

## Note

Not make pull requests. Fork/Clone the repo instead and work on it. Master branches only.

There is no need to deploy infrastructure to AWS. Just make sure it fully valid terraform infrastructure-as-code setup.
